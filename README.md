* **Sticky Navigation Bar:** Provides easy navigation that stays at the top of the page on scroll.
* **Hero Section:** A full-height landing area to grab the user's attention.
* **Custom Components:** Features custom-styled sections that override and extend default Bootstrap styles.

* **Modern CSS Techniques:**
    * **CSS Custom Properties (Variables):** Used for a clean, manageable, and themeable color palette (see `bondi.css`).
